### Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews: VADER, Lexical Scoring, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks

Summary: 
This code performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using VADER for lexical scoring and semantic enhancements. The process includes data preprocessing (normalization and stopword removal), calculating sentiment scores with VADER, and classifying reviews into five sentiment categories (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive). Additional scoring is applied for extreme sentiment words. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Feedforward Neural Networks, are used to evaluate sentiment classification performance, with accuracy and confusion matrices displayed for model assessment.
